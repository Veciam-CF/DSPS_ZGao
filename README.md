Data science, or machine learning is very practical in research, and maybe I will combine them into my research as well. That's why I choose this course. 
Also, I want to improve my knowledge about statistics, especially about Bayesian statistics, which I don't have many experience.
I have plenty of experience in python and have read some instructions about ML, which might be helpful.
