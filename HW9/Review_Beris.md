I think that both your old and new plot respect Tuft's 5 rules. Your changes improved the ambiguity of
your plot. Makeing the error bars have bars at the top and bottom made the orange error bar more 
visible which improved the readability and thus the ambiguity. I think that the decision to zoom in on the y
axis was a good choice as it brought the focus more onto the 3 points that are important, but maybe I would have just
made the bottom bound of the y axis 0 instead of 100, in order to avoid accidentally distorting the data and making
the difference between the black and colored bars bigger than it is. 
I think that one improvement to make the plot even better would be to move the legend to the bottom 
right corner so that it is not overlapping with your data. 

Bad plot from literature:

I do agree that this plot looks very cluttered, and that alpha could be used in order to make the 
overlapping data more visible. In addition to that I would choose different colors. Many of the data
use similar colors, and that does lead me to wonder if that was done on purpose or if it was just
coincidence.
