The old one is this:<img width="581" height="432" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/420fa13e-6679-4c47-ac7c-6873bf4fac08" />


Here is the new image I made.

I improved it because the orignial one left too many empty space in the botttom part of the figure. Also, the yellow bar was coverd by the black one. I think by shifting the y range of the figure
could let the figure looks more concentrate on curve. Also, the new yellow bar could be more clear.



For the second part of HW, the plots I choose and post on slack are:Bad one:

I thought there are too many data points with complicated symbols in a same figure, especailly in the right bottom of plot,
I agree with the point that those data are necessary, but I still want to improve it. Maybe try not to use so many grey colors, especially when lots of them overlap in a small region.
Also, alpha parameter should be used, I think alpha=0.8 might be good. Also, I will not use symbols like black star in this plot. Since it takes too many space
but contains the same volume of information as other shapes, which will draw too many attentions just because of the size.
