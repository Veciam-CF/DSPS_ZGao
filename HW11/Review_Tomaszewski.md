These plots come from the MWrotCurve assignment from HW 4, and were made by Zhuoran Gao. The plots represent a galaxy's (Either M31 or the Milky Way's) orbital velocity as a function of radius in kpc. Some of the inital imporvements include the changing of the scaling to show values only between 100 and 325 instead of what appears to be 0 to 400, this reduces white space significantly. The addition of grid lines also improves clarity significantly.

In terms of ambiguity, distortion, and distraction: I believe that ambiguity still exists, as there is no plot title, and I'm unsure what tje numbers in paratheses under the three xradius values represents. Distortion was improved drastically by scaling the  plot to show only the data and by citting white space. Distraction is about the same, as there were no unecessary fetures between plots. In terms of tufte's rules, effect size is about one, as there are numerical quantities represented but they are all represented accordintly sized. The data to ink ratio is much greater than one. However, it might be worth noting the numbers in parethesies and their relavence here. There is no chart junk. Small multiples are not here,a dn I believe there is no reduntent communication. The plot is not color-blind complient, however.

The bad plot has a lot that can be changed to put it lightly. There is so much ambiguity here, I have no idea what is even being measured. I have no idea why error only exits in some data and noth others, why Rigby's data points are the same as some error bar styles, and there is so much that overlaps It is impossible to see what datapoints exist in some areas. In therms of distortion, I believe that the x-axis is on a log scale, but this is not specified. In terms of distraction, I am distracted by how much junk there is in the plot.

In terms of Tufte's 5, I can't make an assertion on the lie factor since I can't even tell what's being measured. Data/ink is not that great since there is so much that is abmiguous. Chat junk, yeah, it's everywhere in terms of points overlapping and too many similar and similarly colored points. Small multiples are not used. I don't believe there is redundancy in communication. The plot does not respect best color practices and is not color-blind compliant.
